Project Title: Analysis of Covid-19 by State
Name of Group: Pandemic Solvers
Team Members: Dasa Simova, Joshua Pohl, Melissa Diep, Shuchi Khandelwal, Paul Shelffo


Project Description/Outline:
Our group is looking to analyze the number of Covid-19 cases in the US by state, and the correlation that population size and income has had in the number of cases per state.


Data sources:
- Data.cdc.gov
    -Description
          -Data sets includes data and metrics for cases (actual and new cases), vaccination (actual vaccines completed, administered), test (positive test, negative test), hospitalization (actual hospital beds), and death (cumulative death).
    -Data can be retrieved by states. 
    -Data set for NJ, time series has 11 319 entries, by counties. 

    -Uses:

    -Use: 
Research Questions to Ask:
- Which state was has the most and least number of Covid-19 cases?
    - cases per month by state/county?
    - cases by age group?
    - cases by state/county/population?
    - cases by state/county average income?


Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
-Get API Key for covidactnow
-Get Datasets in csv 
  -Get Dataset as per county/state

-Do  Analysis to get a

Covid Act Now API
    -Data sets includes data and metrics for cases (actual and new cases), vaccination (actual vaccines completed, administered), test (positive test, negative test), hospitalization (actual hospital beds), and death (cumulative death).
    -Data can be retrieved by states. 
    -Data set for NJ, time series has 11 319 entries, by counties. 
    *we need to find API about age and COVID analysis

Census API
    -we need some information on the states /state/county level about average income, and other stats about wealth, education level 

Age statistics -

Question / problems:
    -	Are we safe -: do a vaccination and new cases relate?
    -	Can linear regression be used to predict or describe COVID 19 over time (years 2020, 2021) based on death rate, vaccination, income/wealth, education level
    -	How NJ vs state in USA can be positioned (statistics over data)
