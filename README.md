Project Title: Analysis of Covid-19 by State
Name of Group: Pandemic Solvers
Team Members: Dasa Simova, Joshua Pohl, Melissa Diep, Shuchi Khandelwal, Paul Shelffo


Project Description/Outline:
Our group is looking to analyze the number of Covid-19 cases in NJ by county, and the correlation that population size, location, and vaccinations has had in the number of cases per NJ county.

Research Questions to Ask:
- Which county was has the most and least number of Covid-19 cases?
            -Hypothesis: most populated county has the most number of cases
- What is the correlation between number of cases and hospitilizations?
            - Hypothesis: very correlated
- What is the correlation between # of vaccinations and # of cases?
            - Hypothesis: very correlated
- What is the correlation between proximity to NY and covid?
            - Hypothesis: closer to NY has more cases

Data sources (can extract NJ by counties):
- https://data.cdc.gov/resource/n8mc-b4w4.json?res_state=NJ
    -Use: metrics for # of cases, # of hospitalizations, # of 
-www.census.gov
    -Use: can find the population data here      
-www.api.covidactnow.org
    -Use: Can get # of vaccinations 
-www.google.com/maps
    -Use: distance from each county to NY
  
Visualization will include:
    - We will show linear regression (3-4 total) line graphs to show correlation for each of our research questions
    - Bar chart to show highest to least number of cases by county
    - Pie chart to show % of total vaccinations by county
    -etc.
