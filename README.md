Covid Act Now API
Data sets includes data and metrics for cases (actual and new cases), vaccination (actual vaccines completed, administered), test (positive test, negative test), hospitalization (actual hospital beds), and death (cumulative death).
Data can be retrieved by states. 
Data set for NJ, time series has 11 319 entries, by counties. 
*we need to find API about age and COVID analysis

Census API
we need some information on the states /state/county level about average income, and other stats about wealth, education level 
Age statistics -

Question / problems:
-	Are we safe -: do a vaccination and new cases relate?
-	Can linear regression be used to predict or describe COVID 19 over time (years 2020, 2021) based on death rate, vaccination, income/wealth, education level
-	How NJ vs state in USA can be positioned (statistics over data)
