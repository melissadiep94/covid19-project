## Project Title: Analysis of Covid-19 in NJ
* Name of Group: Pandemic Solvers
* Team Members: Dasa Simova, Joshua Pohl, Melissa Diep, Shuchi Khandelwal, Paul Shelffo


## Project Description/Outline:
* Our group is looking to analyze the number of Covid-19 cases in NJ by county, and the correlation that population size, location, and vaccinations has had in the number of cases per NJ county.

## Research Questions:
1. What is the correlation between population size and # of cases?
    - Hypothesis: very correlated
1. What is the correlation between # of hospitalizations of # of cases?
    - Hypothesis: very correlated
1. What is the correlation between # of vaccinations and # of cases?
    - Hypothesis: very correlated
1. What is the correlation between age and # of cases?
    - Hypothesis: very correlated

## Data sources:
1. https://data.cdc.gov/resource/n8mc-b4w4.json?res_state=NJ
    - Use: metrics for # of cases, # of hospitalizations 
1. www.census.gov
    - Use: can find the population data here      
1. www.api.covidactnow.org
    - Use: Can get # of vaccinations 
1. www.google.com/maps
    - Use: distance from each county to NY
  
## Visualization will include:
* We will show linear regression (3-4 total) line graphs to show correlation for each of our research questions
* Bar chart to show highest to least number of cases by county
* Pie chart to show % of total vaccinations by county
* etc.
